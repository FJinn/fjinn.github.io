Fragment shader is used for creating the effects showed in gif above, including color wave formation, greyscale circle, color circle scaling etc.

The concept behind is to tweak and adjust the values with trigonometry.

For one, the wave formation is based on trigonometry as trigonomtry such as sine has a pretty neat shape of wave while plotted in a graph.

Audio spectrum is used to move/scale/rotate the objects/color to create the effects showed.
