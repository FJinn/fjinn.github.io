# Mood - Draft 1

## Part 1 - Description of a place or event

He stared into his anxious eyes. The first thing came into his sight was the blood red veins, then those dark eye bags. The eyebrows in the mirror were crumpled together. The tap water was running. Still, he could catch the sound of his rapid pacing breath. And his heartbeat was dragging by it. He was sweating. Profusely and cold.

The glaring light on top of his head was buzzing. He would have cursed the sketchy estate agent. But not tonight. This was the 13th time. He could barely close his eyes. At least that was what he wanted. And failed, over and over. It was not the caffeine. Nor the lady on the bed. It was the dreadful news he heard at dusk.

“A 22 years old student found dead in his dormitory. The deceased time was presumed to be around midnight. Cause of death was unclear. According to his roommates, he was screaming about someone was staring at him after he woke up from his nightmare. It happened multiple times before his death. The police…”

He splashed water on his face, trying to get rid of those unnecessary thoughts. Exhausted. That was his excuse. He took a deep breath and it felt a little better. It was vague, but the eerie sense of being stared was still there. He had no clue on how long it had been there. But whenever he closed his heavy eyelids, it appeared. The haunted shadow in his mind was getting more solid with every second passed. And it was standing one head away from his face, staring at him, quietly.

## Part 2 - Dialogue

“Have you done?” The lady sounded tired. “…Babe, you’re just exhausted.”

“… I’m just too tired…yes…I am just too tired.” The man reassured himself with a trembling voice.

“Would you like me to call your shri…the doc?” The mumbling voice concerned her.

“No! Wait… please, babe. Just…just give me a break…I, I’m feeling better now.” He never sounded this soft as if he was begging. He swore this was not about those crazy things in his past, but the lady seemed yet to be convinced.

“O-Okay…Just come out when you’re ready.” She tried to sound at ease. “I’m always right here, on the bed.”

What if… she was right? NO! It can’t be! But…what if…

“…Babe…May…Maybe, you…you’re right.” He was reluctant to accept but it could be worse. Or, he just lost his judgement from what was happening.

She did not respond. It was too quick for falling back to sleep, and she always replied him.

“…Babe? ...Babe?!” His pitch was up and down. The uncanny feeling was getting stronger and stronger.

“IT’S NOT FUNNY!” The man voice was crackly. “BABE?!”

## Part 2 - Dialogue

“Babe, you’re just exhausted.” The fair lady could not care less about her messy hair at this point. Her voice that could lure singing bird in was long gone with her vigour.

“I-I’m just to-too tired…y-yes…” The man reassured himself with a trembling voice. “I. Am. Just. Too. Tired.” He muttered under his breath, one word after another, as if he wanted those words to be engraved in his mind.

“Would you like me to call your shri…the doc?” It really concerned her, as from what she could remember, he was never a man to be categorized with mumbling voice.

“No! Wait… please, babe. Just…just give me a break…I, I’m feeling better now.” He never sounded this soft yet desperate as if he was begging. He swore this was not about those crazy things in his past, but the lady seemed yet to be convinced.

“O-Okay…Just come out when you’re ready.” She tried to sound at ease. “I’m always right here, on the bed.”

She did not respond. It was too quick for falling back to sleep, and she always replied him.

“…Babe? ...Babe?!” His pitch was up and down. The uncanny feeling was getting stronger and stronger.

“IT’S NOT FUNNY!” The voice quavered as he looked at the creeping shadow under the door. “BABE?!”
