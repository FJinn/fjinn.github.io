# Structure - Draft 1

## Game Premise

A private investigator discovers he was in a clone experiment while finding evidence to prove himself innocent.

## Game Objectives

Gather information to create distraction through conversation. Find important pieces in an area. Solve a jigsaw puzzle to restructure information. Solve a tiling puzzle to remember events. Solve tile matching puzzle to convince someone. Solve chain reaction puzzle when deal with machine.

## Act 1

---

### Introduction

In 2022, Washington D.C., a 26 years old private investigator, Robert was troubling by his income. The main reason was Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPDC) favour in having someone, innocent or not, to be convicted of the crime as it was way more efficient than spending weeks to investigate for justice.

### Inciting incident

Police with arrest warrant showed up at his front door. Robert was suspected for a murder case, where his DNA was all over the crime scene. Knowing how the department worked, he needed to distract them and run away.

### Plot point

His CSI friend gave him the crime report and all the evidences pointed to him. He had no alibi as he was drinking alone when the crime happened. However, he recalled when his finger was wounded and the fingerprints in crime scene did not. Both then convinced their police captain to help.

## Act 2

---

### Set up

They visited the victim’s associate, a Cellular Biology professor, who suspected another colleague who had disagreements with the victim. In the car, Robert reflected his life being ironic as he got to investigate a crime only when he was a suspect. When they reached the institution, there was a scream.

### Midpoint

The colleague was stabbed and lying on the ground. Before he died, his dying message pointed to the professor. They were managed to grab the deceased's laptop for evidences.

### Plot point

After searching through the data, it was revealed that Robert was under a secret cloning experiment conducted by both victims and the professor. They confronted the professor in his secret underground laboratory, full of tank with unconscious clones inside. He explained that one of the clones broke out and apparently was seeking his vengeance.

## Act 3

---

### Set up

A man who looked almost identical with Robert appeared. They managed to catch and tie him up after a fight. While they were unguarded, the professor tased and tied all of them up.

### Dark night of the soul

The professor then explained, Robert was one of the clones of his deceased son. Unlike animal cloning, his study hypothesized human might survive longer than the progenitor.

### Pep Talk

While Robert was feeling despair and drown in his sorrow, he remembered his friends supports. Finally, he came to his senses.

### Climax

Robert successfully distracted and knocked down professor. While his friends handed professor and the murderer to MPDC, he decided to destroy the laboratory and killed all the clones through the laboratory machine.

### Denouement

Robert 'identical twin' killed the victims and set him up was the ‘truth’ released to the public. He left the city for a new life, but until the day he died, Robert would always be haunted by the dying expression of every single clone.
