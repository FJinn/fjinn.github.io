# Scene - Draft 1

## Set Design

Hero comes back from the victory against demon army, only discovers his/her hometown is dead silence. Unlike its entrance, the town is a mess. Things are all over the ground with numerous shoe prints on top of them. As the hero travels to his/her home, most of the doors do not close tight, some are wide-open. Windows are broken and shatters into tiny glass shards. There are scratches on the fountain at town centre. The statue on it is undamaged but there is no water falling from its vase. Judging from its façade, hero’s house is surprisingly the most intact building in the town.

## Lighting

The lighting at the entrance is warm and bright. As the hero proceeds to his/her house, the light setting is still warm but getting a little dimmer, as to carry out the feeling of a long abandon ruin. Hero cannot see clearly what is inside of any houses as the lighting inside is pitch dark. The lighting of fountain statue is a little brighter than the surrounding building yet with a darker colour tone. This stresses its meaning of being the centre of the town as a landmark, its representation as the soul of the town, and hero is getting closer to his/her destination. Hero’s house has both colour and lighting a little brighter than the surrounding building as it informs the hero this is the destination. Looking from outside, nothing can be seen as it is pitch dark inside.

## Costume

Hero is wearing his/her armour and equipping the weapon that he/she uses to defeat the demon army. The armour is full of cuts and loses its shiny colour it has when first meets the hero. Even a child can tell the armour cannot withstand another strike. The longsword rests behind hero’s back is no longer intimidating. Its handle is covered by dry blood stains and its blade is full of cracks, blunt, and broken into half.

## Location

Hero’s hometown is used to be a lively town that full of smiles and joys. People often gathers at the centre of the town, a fountain with a statue pouring water from its vase. When there is sunlight, adults are working hard, children are playing when they are finished with their study; when the moon appears, everyone has their fun near the fountain, chatting, singing, and dancing. It is busy at day; peaceful and heart-warming at night. Now, it is just a ghost town.

## Player Experience

When player defeats demon army and heads back to his/her hometown, player first see the intact entrance and realize something is different from before as the town is too quiet. As player proceeds, he/she sees the mess inside the town, which leads player to think of a chaotic incident has happened. When player reaches hero’s house, he/she can clearly tell something is waiting the hero inside the house as it is the only building that is different from other building in the town. Based on this scene, player knows there will be an incident or even a tough fight waiting inside hero’s house which will explain everything.

## Meaning

The entrance of the town and the façade of hero’s house symbolize things can have two different sides: whatever player sees at first sight may not be the truth. The true demon king sits inside the hero’s house. It is just an illusion of the hero defeating the demon army.

## Meaning

The ordinary entrance of the town and the mess inside the town; Undamaged armour loses its shiny colour; Sheathed sword that has broken into half; Undamaged angel statue with no water flowing from its vase; these symbolize things can have two different sides: whatever player sees at first sight may not be the truth. Everything player sees telling player, things do not appear as what he/she sees. The only intact building’s façade tells the player it is the destination/venue that will advance the game/story: The true demon king sits inside the hero’s house. It is just an illusion of the hero defeating the demon army.
