## Setting

It happened near the end of 7th Century, to be exact, 674 BC, which was under medieval period. At this era, wars could be seen everywhere especially at Sea of Marmara, where Constantinople (modern Istanbul) is located. In the mentioned year, the Arab fleet sailed from its bases in the eastern Aegean and entered the Sea of Marmara as it was part of the Arab conquest.

Byzantine Empire was one of many targets in Arab conquest. The enemy’s fleet was double of the Byzantine Empire’s, yet the Byzantine emperor, Constantine IV managed to defend his people for six months, from April to September. The clashes between Arabian Empire and Byzantine Empire were constantly happened from morning until evening, between the outworks of the Golden Gate (First gate of the Walls of Constantinople, from south to north) and the Kyklobion (Zeytinburnu, European side of Istanbul).

Callinicus was an alchemist from Heliopolis of Syria who studied in the Alexandrian chemical school (Alexandria, second largest city in Egypt). A wicked witchcraft, War Fire was near to finish but no one was able to figure out the last ingredient. It was Callinicus who came out with a plausible solution, which was to complete the recipe with a life of an innocent child. Aside from the questionable humanity, no one could validate the theory due to the place was overrun by Arab conquest. Consequently, Callinicus became a Syrian refugee who fled to Constantinople and presented War Fire to the troubled Byzantine emperor.

## Premise

An honourable Byzantine emperor struggles in choosing to cross the line for greater good or to save his own morality.
