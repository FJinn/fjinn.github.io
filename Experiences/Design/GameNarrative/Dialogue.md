# Dialogue - Draft 1

Hans: “Don’t make any noise. They will hear us.”

Grey: “So? They are slow and dumb. Our machetes can split their heads into half.”

Hans: “There are hordes. It never hurts to be careful.”

Grey: “You’re just being para–”

Hans: “LOOK OUT!”

Grey: “Aim for the head!”

Hans: “There are too many of them!”

Grey: “The gym behind you! Quick!”

Hans: “Over here!”

Grey: “Push the shelf!”

Hans: “It should keep them out…”

Grey: “Keep us in too.”

Hans: “What about the slow and dumb?”

Grey: “Shut up. If only I had guns.”

Hans: “There should be another exit.”

Grey: “Yea, two exits for a gym toilet.”

Hans: “You just can’t stop being ‘talkative’, huh?”

Grey: “If you stop acting like the boss.”

Hans: “I admire his leadership, and what’s wrong with that?”

Grey: “What’s wrong with my annoyance?”

Hans: “Just… find an exit, we still need to look for food.”

Grey: “I’m pretty sure there are food for seven in a mall full of dead, plus they don’t need the food.”

Hans: “But we are their food, and night is coming.”

Grey: “Your grandfather would be ashamed of us. Skilled hunters become prey. How ironic is that?”

Hans: “He taught us hunting, not killing the dead.”

Grey: “… should have trained us in the dark.”

Hans: “*Just don’t hunt in the dark.*”

Grey: “Hah, you sound just like him! … Who would have thought dead can ever comeback to–”

Hans: “Found it! Here’s the second exit!”

Grey: “Vent? Can it even support our weight?”

Hans: “Or you want to stay here and wait for a rescue? A friendly reminder, this world doesn’t belong to us anymore.”

Grey: “…I know. Just… everything went down too fast… feel like it was just yest–”

Hans: “Shhhh! Lower your voice. Just find the food and head back to the camp.”

Grey: “Whatever.”

Grey: “So? They are slow and dumb. Our machetes can split their heads into half.”

Hans: “Can’t kill hordes. Nothing wrong with careful.”

Grey: “Paranoi–”

Hans: “LOOK OUT!”

Hans: “What’s wrong with that?”

Grey: “What’s wrong with my annoyance?”

Hans: “Just… find an exit, we still need to look for food.”

Grey: “Or just starve to death. C’mon, I’m pretty sure there are food for seven in a mall full of dead.”

Hans: “But we are their food, and night is coming.”

Grey: “Skilled hunters become prey. How ironic is that for the apprentices of the Great Hunter?”

Hans: “He taught us hunting, not killing the dead.”

Grey: “… should have trained us in the dark.”

Hans: “Or you want to stay here and wait for a rescue? A friendly reminder, this world doesn’t belong to us anymore.”

Grey: “It will, eventually. Cause we think and they don’t.”

Hans: “Shhhh! Lower your voice. Just find the food and head back to the camp.”

Grey: “Whatever.”
