## People

- The sun's rays are stronger at higher elevations — UV radiation (Cause skin cancer) exposure increases 4 to 5 percent with every 1,000 feet above sea level.
- Darker skin protects the body from absorbing too many UV rays. ([Source](https://australianmuseum.net.au/learn/science/human-evolution/how-have-we-changed-since-our-species-first-appeared/))
- Have about 20 % more blood than a lowlander and 60 % more, by weight, of haemoglobin (which absorbs oxygen), and their red blood cells are larger, meaning a greater surface area for oxygen absorption.
- Means blood of high mountain people is thicker than a lowlander, which relates to why they have a larger, stronger heart, and indeed it is about a fifth larger. Their lungs are larger as well.
- Hands and feet are so well supplied with small arteries and veins that they are almost immune to frostbite

## Beliefs and religion

Quinoa plant

- Mountain people share one belief and religion, which is: God of Mountain. They believe everything that happens to them is the making of Mountain God since their life is heavily relied on mountain. They normally eat food like corn (takes 9-10 months to mature at high altitudes), potatoes, seeds of quinoa plants, and yak. All of them require ‘mountain (ground/soil)’ to grow/live.

## Arts and language

Cloud art

- Since they spend most of their lifetime on the mountain, their knowledge/aesthetic value is limited. Therefore, most of their arts (picture on clothes, tents, drawing etc.) are referred from their surroundings. For example, clouds, mountains, forest, animals, people, flowers etc.
- As their life condition, especially economic is autarky, they rarely have any interaction with foreigners. They are friendly and welcome outsiders but due to the geographical location, they rarely have one. Therefore, they only speak one language and although it sounds completely different, it is developed from the common language of lowlanders. Due to the hardship of living at high altitudes (such as dry and thin air, and cold temperature), they have shortened the language/words (happened over a long period) to save energy for maintaining body heat.

## Attire

Peruvian Girl

- As the temperature on the mountain is too cold, mountain people harvest wool from shaggy coated yak. They usually wear 3-4 layers of the clothes made of yak wool. As the mountain people have art culture, they sew the patterns of clouds, flowers, mountains etc. on their attire.

## Shared experiences

Yak

- Yak is very important to all mountain people as it is their key to survival. Not only is the yak an all-terrain vehicle for hauling goods, but it also provides mountain people meat, wool, milk, cheese and butter. The mountain people also use the yak hides to make portable tents for the herdsmen, and they burn the yak dung for heating and cooking. Cheese and butter also serve as their tribute to the Mountain God.
- Mountain people often chew on the leaves of coca plant as it contains chemicals that dull the nerves, making them feel warmer and stronger.

## Customs and traditions

In normal days, mountain people sleep quite early as it is pretty dark at night. Every last day of the month, mountain people will stay up late as they all gather around and celebrate their hard work for the entire month. The joyful celebration is passed down by their ancestors who had to survive the harsh conditions day after day without all those well-established cultures and resources. It is their custom to wake up before sunrise as it is a form of appreciation towards the sun that brings them warm and light.
