- One of the social forces in SS15 is the institution, INTI International College Subang. Normally, an institution has its rules/controls over certain people. In this case, INTI should have some rules for their students. For example, they may be restricted to not wear shorts or any erotic outfits within the area. Since the majority of the SS15 ‘society’ is students, their proper attires may create social contagion/pressure, which affects the residents in SS15 also avoid erotic outfits.

## Student

- Since INTI International College Subang is located at SS15, students are a big part of SS15 society. Therefore, students are a form of social force in SS15. One of the results of this social force is possibly the variety of food and shop. As INTI has both international and local students, it creates opportunities in the SS15 market.

For example,

- Western food for international students who came from the west and Asian food for the locals.

- Students in SS15 are possibly one of the reasons for the development of SS15 LRT station too. The existence of both international and local students influences the SS15 society in the transportation context.
- As they are not SS15’ permanent residents, students require transportation to return to their hometown from SS15, vice versa.

## Merchant

- As mentioned, there are various shops in SS15. Thus, merchant is another form of social force in SS15.

- One of the obvious influences from SS15 merchants is the traffic condition in SS15. Since there are plenty of shops, the residents, students, or even workers in/nearby SS15 often pay visits to SS15. Consequently, it causes the bad traffic condition in SS15 where the visitors have difficulties to find parking. When the visitors are finding parking, the residents are stuck in the slow traffic even though they may not want to visit the merchant shops in SS15.

- Besides traffic, since merchants in SS15 fulfill both basic and leisure needs of the society, it creates opportunity for developers.
- Due to merchants, SS15 becomes an area where the society within it does not need to worry about food. Thus, outsiders may want to move and live in SS15, which causes the developers to develop more residence in SS15.
