# 'Field Trip' To SS15

To get a grasp on a location, what is better than a field trip?

No matter what kind of a world we are creating, we always need references to bring it to life. Personal experiences are what make the created world believable to the audiences.

## Tall Buildings

These are one of the tall buildings in SS15. The height is the interesting part of the building as most of the buildings in SS15 are relatively low, averagely 2-3 floors height. In a game, players like to climb/go to the top of a mountain/building (Skyrim/GTA) as it gives the player a sense of achievement and the clear view of the ‘world’.

## LRT Station

Building in the picture is SS15 LRT station. It is an interesting spot as it is one of the main transportations the society uses to reach/leave SS15. The large size of the building and height also contribute to its interesting element. In addition, it is located next to the commercial area of SS15.

## Spacious Building

This is another building with large space in SS15. It is a carpark in the commercial area of SS15. As SS15 is a busy area, those car park slots beside the street are fully occupied especially during peak hour. This carpark can be a potentially interesting spot in a game because it is spacious and players can hardly know what is inside from merely judging from outside. In other words, it is an exploration spot for players.

## Construction

Again, another spacious building in SS15. It is an interesting spot as it is spacious and still under construction. As it is under development, it provides the feeling of unknown to the players and thus, another exploration venue for players. Furthermore, as it is still under construction, there is a sense of thrill/danger as the building is not stable/complete yet.

## Market

A spacious building(pasar/market) in SS15. It stands out because there is nothing connected with it. Most of the buildings in the area are connected with each other but not this building. Besides, it is the only building with architecture that is similar to Malay House in SS15. The uniqueness of it makes it an interesting spot compared to all the other buildings in SS15.
