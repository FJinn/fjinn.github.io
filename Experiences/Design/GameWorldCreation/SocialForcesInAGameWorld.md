Merchant is one of the social forces in this religious town. A temple that has unique architecture in this religious town attracts a lot of visitors. When there are people, there are needs. Merchant trades things from visitors and residents and this avoids the village from a closed economy. Things that get traded also affect the residents’ lifestyle, such as books for more knowledge about the outside world; or leisure items that make their life easier/happier. In short, a merchant is a bridge to link the residents and the outside world.

## Abbot/Monks

As a religious town, the religion, specifically abbot/monk is one of social forces that can greatly influence the populace. In fact, it serves as a teaching institution for the residents. Abbot or monks teach the resident moral values, knowledge of their god, and even knowledge of the world. Their teaching causes the residents to have faith and courage, and most importantly, it guides them in differentiating right and wrong.

## Monk soldiers/Guardian

Monk soldiers are the only physical forces in the religious town. This means that they are the social force that has physical power. Their work is to keep the temple safe and protect the town from any possible harms. Due to their power, the populace feels safe with their presence. The populace also trusts and respects them as they are the guardians of the temple who are blessed and chosen by god messenger (abbot).

## Prayers

In a religious town, prayer is one of the social forces. Prayer (residents/visitors), who have faith in this religion, often pay visits to the temple. Donations may be made in those visits. The donated money or food is used to sustain the temple and monks daily basic needs. Prayer is one of the important roles in the ecosystem of this religious town. Without prayer, there is no temple/religion; without temple/religion, the populace may leave as their reason to stay disappears; without the populace, there will be less/no prayers. Every element in the cycle is important as their presence keeps the cycle balance.

## Children

The fifth social force will be children. Children are the future of the world and everyone in the town knows it, especially the monks and their teaching. Because of the children, the temple even provides a space and serves as a school. The populace will send their children to temple in the morning to learn about knowledge and teaching, and pick them up at sunset. This has become the populace’s daily routine and greatly influences their life.
