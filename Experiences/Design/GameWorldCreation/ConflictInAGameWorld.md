# Conflict In Arid Desert - Vast Wilderness

This is a discussion between 3 group members including me. The discussion was about the possible conflicts in arid desert.

## Races

The Vast Wilderness is a republican society. Representatives are elected from each race to meet and discuss how jobs and resources should be delegated. Each race has equal social standing and are expected to cooperate in the harsh desert environment to survive.

- Strongest and don’t need as much water to survive
- Dig waterways, protect the people, miners
- Provide security for the settlement

- Farmers and Strategists
- The main food supply for the settlement, which are mainly crops, cactus and desert livestocks such as cows and camels
- Highest intelligence among the rest which can provide strategic advice and take use of the knowledge of natural environment as advantage

### Dwarves

## First Conflict

### Lizardman Faction

#### Advantage: Underground tunnels

#### Disadvantage: Harsh temperatures

#### Cause: Moving the settlement into the underground tunnels

- Lizardmen believe that moving into the underground tunnels is safer as sandstorms can’t reach the settlement there.
- Further cause through soft-power by using their experience as guards to convince the other races that the settlement will be safer if it is moved underground.
- Convince dwarves that living underground is safer first so that they can form an alliance with the dwarves to make technology that can enrich their lives underground (e.g. creating technology that can monitor the underground temperature, invent an artificial sun for farming, etc.)
- By forming an alliance with the dwarves, it will be easier to convince the humans that living underground is beneficial as they will still be able to farm and can avoid the harsh desert environment.

#### Weakness: Harsh temperatures

- Lizardmen are cold-blooded, when the temperatures are too low, they become slow and vulnerable
- Use soft power to convince dwarves to create temperature-regulating armour for them in exchange for special security services.
- If dwarves do not cooperate, they can threaten to stop protecting them or ban them from using the underground tunnels if the settlement gets attacked.

### Dwarves Faction

#### Advantage: Major producer of Earth element magic products

#### Disadvantage: No constant water supply

#### Cause: Mining Earth element magic products

- Due to their natural talent, dwarves mine the majority of the Earth element magic products which aid in the settlement’s economy.
- Further cause through soft-power by controlling the supply of Earth element magic products and temperature-regulating armor made with their technology.
- Dwarves convince other races, without the temperature-regulating armor, they will face difficulties for surviving in arid desert.

#### Weakness: Need large amount of water

- Since they sweat a lot while mining and crafting (especially in arid desert), they require extra water to stay hydrated.
- Dehydration is one of the death causes for dwarfs in arid desert while mining.
- Therefore, they often use soft-power to bargain (with Earth element magic products) with others to get water supply.

### Humans Faction

#### Advantages: Main strategist that can use natural environment for strategic advantage (Natural Barrier)

#### Disadvantages: Cannot avoid natural disasters such as Sandstorm that will destroy crops. (Sandstorm)

#### Cause: Food source in the settlement and also the highest intelligence

- Having the knowledge of the natural environment, humans can find a way to solve environmental problems. Thus they are the main food producer for the settlement.
- Humans can take advantage of the natural environment due to the knowledge, which can provide strategic advice which can greatly improve the defence and build a stronger settlement.

#### Weakness: Weakest among the rest and can’t avoid natural disasters

- Natural disasters such as Sandstorms are unpredictable so humans can’t do much about it. Natural disasters will most likely destroy the crops and livestocks in the settlement and also probably kill humans even if they’re hiding in houses as desert houses have open holes instead of windows to lower the temperature.
- Providing meat and advice to the lizardmen, in exchange seek for military protection and hiding in tunnels when Sandstrom strikes as lizardmen know the underground better.
- Same for the dwarfs for the food supplies, but humans can also help dwarfs solve the water problem as they can plan and build water systems which provide more efficiency. In return, they needed the temperature-regulating armor to survive the natural environment.

## Second Conflict

- The Vast Wilderness is interested in obtaining R’vicores from R’vic in the rocky mountains.
- Mainly interested in obtaining their R’vicore weapons so that they have a stronger offense against intruders.
- As The Vast Wilderness does not have enough attack power, they cannot use hard power to get the R’vicores, they have to use soft power and strike a deal with R’vic.
- In addition, The Vast Wilderness focuses on surviving in a hard environment and that means it is probably not a good idea to go to war while the populace is barely able to self-sustain with their current resources.
- They will offer Earth magic products in exchange for R’vicore weapons.

### How The Vast Wilderness will approach R’vic:

- Send a group of merchants as messengers with our Earth magic product sample.
- Once they agree to trade, send representatives to meet and discuss the trade agreement with their leader.
- Form a trade agreement.
- Further establish both settlements’ relationship and fortify the agreement.
- If they disagree to trade, ask for the price they want/prefer and negotiate.
- If they insist on not trading, ask for peace between two settlements or form an alliance. (In case they are hostile)
