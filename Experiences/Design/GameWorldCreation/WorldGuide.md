### Key Location 2: Mountain Cliff

#### City Plan & Environment

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FJinn/fjinn.github.io/master/Experiences/Design/GameWorldCreation/Images/Mountain.jpg?raw=true" width="600" height="450" >

An area of mountain with cliffs. With fertile soil and fresher air (high altitude), it provides a good environment for some populace to live. The ancient populace who lived there even built the building(temple) into the cliff. Due to the risk, current populace no longer lives at the cliff but somewhere near (on flat ground). Going up (left) is heading to the cliff (temple) while right is heading to lower ground, lake, and forest. It is more like a tribe than a city/town, which means the populace live together in a relatively tighter and smaller space.

- There is a lighthouse to guide the fisherman; two paths that allow the populace to head to sea which one is near the lighthouse and the other near the rear of the area. Due to the slope, the buildings are closely built near each other and a bigger gap between obstacle/building is accounted as a path from the populace (unstructured road).
