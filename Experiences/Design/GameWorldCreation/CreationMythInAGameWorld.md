### Ex Nihilo

- God creates the world out of nothing. Human is His first and favourite child. For human to live, He creates land so human have a place to live; creates sky to protect human from the complete darkness; creates stars and sun so human can be guided by the light; creates other creatures so human is no longer lonely; creates creatures that live in darkness to test human faith and courage; creates magic/spell for human to protect themselves from the creatures that came from darkness.
- When He creates human, He gives human emotions as He wants human to learn and feel. He teaches His children knowledge through miracle or dream. As a result, a religion is formed to worship His greatness and follows/inherits His teaching.
- The followers believe that whoever practices His teaching will return to a paradise after death. Although it may appear in different forms for everyone, the paradise is believed to have no pain, sadness, and any negative emotions. Some even believe paradise is His home, where it is warm, happy, and stress-free.

- It is a world that has magic. Not every living thing can cast magic. Therefore, those who have magic are respected by others. It even forms a social status where spell/magic casters are on top of the pyramid. Normally, children with age 6 will be tested if they are able to cast spell/magic. Latest by age 10, if a child still cannot cast a spell, he/she is a muggle, a regular human with no magic/spell potential.
- Magic/Spell casters do not chant. They cast a magic/spell by communicating (unspeakable language) and link with nature in their mind. The strength of the spell/magic depends on the communication and intensity of the linkâ€™s level.

### Multiple Language

- Since the world is enormous, there are multiple languages and each civilization has their own common language. However, religious teachings are translated into multiple languages by missionaries who are sent to guide people that is not in the same religion.
- Normally, merchants, immigrants, and missionaries are the one that know more than one language. As the world is a dangerous place, the majority does not travel far away from home. Therefore, other languages are not needed by most of the populace in their entire life.
