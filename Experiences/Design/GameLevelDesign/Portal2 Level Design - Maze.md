# Maze
Made in Portal 2 Level Editor

My friends and I made a 4 hour game jam which is to create a game level using Portal 2 in-game level editor.

Never play the game before, so some of the mechanics were a bit fuzzy to me.

Overall, it is a nice experience and I have more understandings about level design and tools in Portal 2 level editor.

Do try it out if you have the game: https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198173147110/myworkshopfiles/?appid=620
