# Proposed Game Mode

This is a documentation about a possible game mode to be added to an existing game from Passion Republic: GigaBash.

The idea is to have a new game mode that is different from current existing one: 

1. Arcade Mode (gauntlet of AI opponents)
2. Onslaught Mode (survive waves of enemies)
3. Mayhem Mode, which is a party mode with various mini-games.
