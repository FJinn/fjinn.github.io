# -> [Spawn Actor](\Experiences\Programming\Python\Unreal\SpawnActors\SpawnSurroundingActors.py) <-

While I was playing around with my Unreal project, I wanted to place multiple actors around an actor on a sphere shape object.

For example, I wanted to place multiple actors surround the actor in the picture above. It could be a really tedious work as it would have required a long time to place everything at the desired postion and rotation.

Instead of manually handling the situation, I wrote a script in Python to handle it by passing in few arguments such as actor to spawn, distance, center actor etc.

Above picture is the result which only requires a few seconds. This helps me to reduce the unnecessary work time.

As my first try on writing Python script to interact with Unreal Editor, it was pretty fun and I am impressed on how writing Python script can help to reduce developer's workload.
