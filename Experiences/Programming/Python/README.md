During Movement Control Order (MCO) period, I spent time to learn another programming language, Python.

I've learnt and finished some exercises from [Google Education Python](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/exercises/log-puzzle).

After some readings and videos watching (such as [Using Python to Streamline Asset Workflows | Unreal Fest Europe 2019 | Unreal Engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOSwlDQY6N0)), I spent some times working on using Python to interact with Unreal Editor.
