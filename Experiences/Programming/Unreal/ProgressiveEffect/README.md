# -> Progressive Effect <-

After I played the game Bastion, made by Supergiant Games, I was impressed by the progressive effect and looked up internet for it. I came across this video tutorial [Bastion Effect, Progressive Level Visibility in Unity using Shader Graph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSt2ypkAXeM), which as the title mentioned, a tutorial about creating Bastion progressive level effect in Unity.

At that time, I was playing around my Unreal project, which was about creating a sphere-like planet and setting up movement and rotation for actors and camera. Instead of Unity's Shader Graph, I studied and recreated a similar result from the video tutorial with Unreal Material Graph.
