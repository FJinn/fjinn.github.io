Recently, I saw an interesting game trailer on Facebook. It is a game from [Playbae](https://www.facebook.com/playbae235) called In My Shadow. Do visit their [PAGE](https://www.playbae.in/inmyshadow/) for more about the game.

*Disclamer: I do not own the gif showed above. It belongs to the game In My Shadow from Playbae**

Looking at the interesting game mechanics, I decided to try it out in Unreal. The following gif is my result.
