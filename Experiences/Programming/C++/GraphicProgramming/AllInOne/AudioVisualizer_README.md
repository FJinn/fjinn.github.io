U,V coordinate of the texture is adjusted based on audio spectrum.

I created the movement of the outer rings based on Game Of Throne tv series opening animation. 

The inner part of the audio visualizer is made up of boxes that intented to represent a castle (as in Game of Throne :) ).

The boxes also coded to scale up based on the audio spectrum.
