The idea is to use Physics such as acceleration, velocity, and position to control boids behaviour in order to move the boids in a smooth and relatively nature way.

**Greed Triangle** = Attractor
**Pink Circle** = Obstacle avoidance
**Orance Circle** = Repeller
**Boids (Blue Triangle) Behaviours** = Separation, Alignment, and Coherence.
