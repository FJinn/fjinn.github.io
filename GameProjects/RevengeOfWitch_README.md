This is the **FIRST** game I made.

As my first step in game development, this game was made in Stencyl. 

While the music is not belonged to me, the art and code are fully created by myself.

In the game, character can create different type of potions to achieve different goals. For example, player can turn enemy into frog or rabbit. In order to kill the enemy, player needs to mix the potions (rabbit type) and throw at the enemy to turn it into rabbit. Once enemy is turned into rabbit, player can now mix another type of potion to kill it.
