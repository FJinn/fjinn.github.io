# [Wandering Soot](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/wandering-soot)

You are a dust mite trying to rescue your friends from the evil boxes. As a dust mite, you must tickle the nose of the Box King which is located in the room and make him sneeze to hopefully release your friends. Be careful as there are 3 boxes in the living room that are patrolling but only one of the boxes will catch you and the other two are your allies. When you have collected all 4 different type of friends, you can then escape through the window and be free!!.
