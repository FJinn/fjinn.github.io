My friends and I participated in this game jam (our second game jam) with only me had a little knowledge about Unity engine (engine we used for this game).

The experience was pretty cool and exciting as we were trying to learn Unity engine together while having the 'deja vu' of Nasty Samurai Wrangler. 

This was meant to be a casual game and we decided to go for a cute art direction.

Although we could not implement all of our ambitious mechanics idea, the game turned out to be okay for us.
