This game jam I tried to develop a game by myself.

I chose to be solo game jammer as I was reading and studying about Bezier Curve and decided to head to implementation of Bezier Curve in this game jam. 

And to have a better understanding, I decided to ditch Unity and Unreal Engine, and only used OpenGL to create a very simple game with Bezier Curve mechanic in it.

I managed to have cubic and quadratic Beizer Curve worked but decided to go for quadratic Bezier Curve only in the game because, well, it still needed to be a game and had to match to the simple game idea I had.
