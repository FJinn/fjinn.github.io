Ethan Fry : Galactic Pirate Chef is a mobile game made in Unity Engine.

I was in charge of making the inventory system for Ethan Fry to gather the ingredients to cook. 

It worked pretty well at first but soon I realized I made a big mistake.

As the development progressed, the game design in terms of inventory system kept changing. 

This caused the coding part became more and more messy and bugs kept popping up.

From this, I learn that a well-planned system can ease up the coding part and it is extremely important to write code in a way that is ready to be changed. 

So I read up some game programming patterns in order to write more versatile and flexible code. Some are implemented for better understandings in my later work.
