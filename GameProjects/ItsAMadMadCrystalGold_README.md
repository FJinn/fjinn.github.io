Another game jam game.

In this game jam, my team and I wanted to make an arcade-like game as none of us had any experience with this genre before.

This was the first game jam for one of my team members and most of us were just a beginner on Unity engine. 

We were all having our good times as all of us were helping each other to get familiar with Unity Engine while trying to put everything together to make a game.
