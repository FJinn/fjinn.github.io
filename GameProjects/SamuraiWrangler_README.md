This is my **FIRST GAME JAM GAME!**

My friends and I were just enrolled in game development course few months ago and with some basic knowledge of Stencyl game engine, we took a leap of faith to join in our first game jam.

It was indeed scary and stressed us out as we could not fully get the game to function as we wanted it to be. The atmosphere was even more horrifying when we saw other participants beahved extremely confident.

To debunk the myth, game jam is not scary at all but fun and joyful. Most of the time, we were just scaring ourselves :smiley:  

Nobody is judging and everyone is friendly enough to help you out without a second thought. 

During the presentation section of the game jam, everyone was having fun including my team and I. We were all laughing at how the bugs turned out to be humorous and amusing :laughing: .
