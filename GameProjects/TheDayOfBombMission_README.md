In this game jam, we were trying to make a digital board game using Unity Engine.

However, none of us had the experience and due to the time limit, we did not spend a lot of time on planning out the system.

This caused our works could not be put together to form a digital game. 

At the last few hours, we made the call to turn the digital board game into an analog.

We did feel sorry about it but all of us were happy that we were able to pull it off even though everything seemed to go wrong at moments.

Nonetheless, it was quite a fresh experience to all of us.
