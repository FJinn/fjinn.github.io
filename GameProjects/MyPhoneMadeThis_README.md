# My Phone Made This

A 36-hour game jam organized by LEVEL UP KL where game developers from all over the South East Asia region work together to create games in a collaborative environment based on a theme!
In this game jam, we made a tamagotchi-like game with the theme of "My Phone Made This".
The idea was to use the picture captured through phone camera to create food to feed and eventually grow an anime girl.
